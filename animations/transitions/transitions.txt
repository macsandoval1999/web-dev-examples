Similar to the animation property, there are a number of rules for transitions that can be defined for each transition sub-property or all at once using the shorthand transition property.

The following transtition properties are available:

transition-property: Specifies the CSS property or properties that should transition when they change.

transition-duration: Defines how long the transition takes to complete.

transition-timing-function: Controls the speed curve of the transition, such as ease, linear, ease-in-out.

transition-delay: Sets how long to wait before starting the transition after a property change.

transition: A shorthand property for all the transition properties.
