    <h1>@keyframes Rule</h1>
    <h2>@keyframes Rule Example1</h2>
    <p>When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times. To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element. The following example binds the "myAnimation" animation to the <div> element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the <div> element from "red" to "yellow":</p>
    <div class="keyframes-rule-ex1"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>@keyframes Rule Example2</h2>
    <p>In the example above we have used the keywords "from" and "to" in the @keyframes rule, which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete). It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like. The following example will change the background-color of the div element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete: Example</p>
    <div class="keyframes-rule-ex2"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>@Keyframes Rule Example3</h2>
    <p>The following example will change both the background-color and the position of the div element when the animation is 25% complete, 50% complete, and again when the animation is 100% complete:</p>
    <div class="keyframes-rule-ex3"></div>
    <hr>



    <h1>animation-delay property</h1>
    <h2>animation-delay Example1</h2>
    <p>The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation. The following example has a 2 seconds delay before starting the animation:</p>
    <div class="animation-delay-ex1"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>animation-delay Example2</h2>
    <p>Negative values are also allowed. If using negative values, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for N seconds. In the following example, the animation will start as if it had already been playing for 2 seconds:</p>
    <div class="animation-delay-ex2"></div>
    <hr>



    <h1>animation-iteration-count property</h1>
    <h2>animation-iteration-count Example1</h2>
    <p>The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run. The following example will run the animation 3 times before it stops:</p>
    <div class="animation-iteration-count-ex1"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>animation-iteration-count Example2</h2>
    <p>The following example uses the value "infinite" to make the animation continue for ever:</p>
    <div class="animation-iteration-count-ex2"></div>
    <hr>



    <h1>animation-direction property</h1>
    <h2>animation-direction Example1</h2>
    <p>The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles. The animation-direction property can have the following values: <br><br>
        normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default<br>
        reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)<br>
        alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards<br>
        alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards<br><br>
        The following example will run the animation in reverse direction (backwards):</p>
    <div class="animation-direction-ex1"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>animation-direction Example2</h2>
    <p>The following example uses the value "alternate" to make the animation run forwards first, then backwards:</p>
    <div class="animation-direction-ex2"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>animation-direction Example3</h2>
    <p>The following example uses the value "alternate-reverse" to make the animation run backwards first, then forwards:</p>
    <div class="animation-direction-ex3"></div>
    <hr>



    <h1>animation-timing-function property</h1>
    <h2>animation-timing-function Example1</h2>
    <p>The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation. The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:<br><br>
    ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)<br>
    linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end<br>
    ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start<br>
    ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end<br>
    ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end<br>
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function<br><br>
    The following example shows some of the different speed curves that can be used:</p>
    <div class="atf animation-timing-function-ex1"></div>
    <div class="atf animation-timing-function-ex2"></div>
    <div class="atf animation-timing-function-ex3"></div>
    <div class="atf animation-timing-function-ex4"></div>
    <div class="atf animation-timing-function-ex5"></div>
    <hr>



    <h1>animation-fill-mode property</h1>
    <h2>animation-fill-mode Example1</h2>
    <p>CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior. The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both). The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:<br><br>
    none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing<br>
    forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)<br>
    backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period<br>
    both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both
    directions<br><br>
    The following example lets the div element retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>
    <div class="animation-fill-mode-ex1"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>animation-fill-mode Example2</h2>
    <p>The following example lets the div element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts (during the animation-delay period):</p>
    <div class="animation-fill-mode-ex2"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>animation-fill-mode Example3</h2>
    <p>The following example lets the div element get the style values set by the first keyframe before the animation starts, and retain the style values from the last keyframe when the animation ends:</p>
    <div class="animation-fill-mode-ex3"></div>
    <hr>



    <h1>animation-shorthand-property</h1>
    <h2>animation Example1</h2>
    <p>The example below uses six of the animation properties:</p>
    <div class="animation-shorthand-ex1"></div>
    <h2>animation Example2</h2>
    <p>The same animation effect as above can be achieved by using the shorthand animation property:</p>
    <div class="animation-shorthand-ex2"></div>
