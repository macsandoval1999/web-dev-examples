<!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS:
    Animating Dialogs with Keyframes: By using CSS keyframe animations, dialogs can have more complex and engaging animations when opening and closing.

    The @keyframes rule allows defining custom animations for dialog transitions.
    The dialog's open and close actions can be tied to these keyframe animations for a polished user experience.

    This example demonstrates how to create a dialog that uses keyframe animations for its opening and closing effects.

    Look at the CSS file for the animation details.
