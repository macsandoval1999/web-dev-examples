<!-- KEY TAKEAWAYS:
    Animating Dialogs: Using CSS transitions and the :open pseudo-class, dialogs can be smoothly animated when opening and closing.

    The @starting-style at-rule allows defining the initial state for transitions.
    The ::backdrop pseudo-element can also be animated for modal dialogs.

    This example demonstrates how to create a dialog that fades in and out when opened and closed.

    Look at the CSS file for the animation details.
