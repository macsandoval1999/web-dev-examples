    <h1>JavaScript Execution Context</h1>
    <p>JavaScript execution context is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It includes the scope, variables, and the value of "this" keyword.</p>
    <p>There are two main types of execution contexts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Execution Context:</strong> This is the default context where the code runs when it is not inside any function. It creates a global object (window in browsers) and a special object called "this".</li>
        <li><strong>Function Execution Context:</strong> This context is created whenever a function is invoked. Each function has its own execution context, which includes its own scope, variables, and "this" value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding execution context is crucial for grasping how JavaScript handles variable scope, closures, and the "this" keyword.</p>
