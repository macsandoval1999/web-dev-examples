    <h1>Difference between Function constructor and function declaration</h1>
    <p>Functions created with the Function constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts; they always are
    created in the global scope. When running them, they will only be able to access their own local variables and global
    ones, not the ones from the scope in which the Function constructor was created. This is different from using eval()
    with code for a function expression.</p>
