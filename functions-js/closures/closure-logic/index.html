    <h2>Closures</h2>
    <p>A closure is when a function remembers the variables from where it was created, even after that outer function is done.
    It’s like a backpack: the function carries the values it needs so it can use them later.</p>
    <p>We also refer to the function body as a closure. A closure is any piece of source code (most commonly, a function) that
    refers to some variables, and the closure "remembers" these variables even when the scope in which these variables were
    declared has exited.<br><br>
    
    Closures are usually illustrated with nested functions to show that they remember variables beyond the lifetime of its
    parent scope; but in fact, nested functions are unnecessary. Technically speaking, all functions in JavaScript form
    closures—some just don't capture anything, and closures don't even have to be functions. The key ingredients for a
    useful closure are the following:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>A parent scope that defines some variables or functions. It should have a clear lifetime, which means it should finish
        execution at some point. Any scope that's not the global scope satisfies this requirement; this includes blocks,
        functions, modules, and more.</li><br>
        <li>An inner scope defined within the parent scope, which refers to some variables or functions defined in the parent scope.</li><br>
        <li>The inner scope manages to survive beyond the lifetime of the parent scope. For example, it is saved to a variable
        that's defined outside the parent scope, or it's returned from the parent scope (if the parent scope is a function).</li><br>
        <li>Then, when you call the function outside of the parent scope, you can still access the variables or functions that were
        defined in the parent scope, even though the parent scope has finished execution.</li>
    </ul>
