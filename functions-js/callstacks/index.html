    <h1>JavaScript Call Stacks</h1>
    <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its
    place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called
    from within that function, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.</li>
        <li>Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are
        reached.</li>
        <li>When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in
        the last code listing.</li>
        <li>If the stack takes up more space than it was assigned, a "stack overflow" error is thrown.</li>
    </ul>
