    <h2>Callbacks in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>A callback is just a function you hand to another function so it can run it later. Think of it like giving someone your
    phone number: they do their thing, then “call you back” when they’re done.<br>
    Example in plain words: “Hey function, do this job, and when you finish, run this other function I gave you.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Check the console and javascript files to see the callbacks in action.</p>
